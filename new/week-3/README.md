## Lesson Plan

> [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/asynchronous-programming/week-2)

Using `import` & `export` to organize your code.

### Isolate

To study these examples and exercises you will need to open each folder's `index.html` file with a server.  You can use the `server.js` file provided in [../isolate](../isolate).

* `import` and `export`: [examples](../isolate/import-export-examples),  [exercises](../isolate/import-export-exercises)

### Integrate

* [Explore Pokemon](../integrate/explore-pokemon-obfuscated) (obfuscated)
* [in-class project](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/explore-pokemon) (starter repository)

## Assignments

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) through `MAKE IT MODULAR`

#### Integrating JavaScript

* Form a group of 2-3 and Complete 1 [JavaScript 30](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/javascript-30) group challenge, your choice!
  * Link to your team's main repository in your homework issue
* Looking for more practice like this?  Check out [Traversy's vanillawebprojects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects) for finished code to reverse-engineer.

#### Suggested Study

##### For the Exercises

* [Mosh: Node.js in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlB_eWDSMt4)
* [Friendly Node.js `fs` guide](https://areknawo.com/node-js-file-system-api-beginner-friendly-guide/)
* [Node.js examples to study](https://github.com/tertiarycourses/NodeJSTraining)

##### For the Project

* [github-api-crash-course tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlE6o-iYcE).  (hint: avoid pushing your GitHub auth token!)
* [what is CORS?](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-cors)

### Project

#### `<username>.github.io`

> [Open-Ended](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission/#projects)

Life comes full circle.  This week your project is to replace the markdown bio you wrote in your first week of HYF with a full portfolio. The only requirements are that it:

1. Uses at least one `class`
1. Uses at least one `import` & `export` statement
1. Showcases the project repos you're most proud of
1. Calls the GitHub API
1. Looks really good ;)

Your finished repository must include:

* A `development-strategy.md` file to explain how you built the portfolio in small pieces
* One branch per step in your `development-strategy.md`
* A project board & issues to track your progress through your development strategy
* A complete README
* A live demo

You will be assessed not only completion, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README.
